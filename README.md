# CODE @ TACC Robotics library

### Introduction

This library wraps functionality for several Adafruit Arduino shield libraries,
as well as provides general compatibility to these libraries. Included is an
example ```robot.ino``` file, to be used as a project base for the
CODE @ TACC Summer 2016 curriculum. Additional
examples may be included for operation of sensors.
